# Datasets
 
Each group has a different Universe to work with, but note that they don't necessarily have the same properties!

At the first lab, you were assigned into 11 groups - these are listed below next to group number. You are welcome to change if you feel a pressing need but if so _please_ tell the lecturer immediately over email.

Here are your datasets, in interactive webpages and in zip files you can download containing everything:

## How to Access and Use the Data
The first step in analysing the data is to get the data! Download one of the .zip files from above according to the difficulty of your choice and unzip it in a directory you'd like to work in.
Upon unzipping the file, you will see these files, or files similar to this (some might be missing):
