## To start off...
This simulation was programmed in Python and it was designed with analysis in Python in mind. Of course, you can use any language you'd like to look at and analyse the data.

I've included a [(WIP) walkthrough](Walkthrough/introduction.md) in how to analyse the data. With that in mind, there are countless different ways that you could look at and analyse the data, all of which having pros and cons. 

## What you can find
In principle, and with enough effort, you could find most of if not all of the physics that is simulated in this program. Below is a non-exhaustive list of what you could determine:

??? note "Stars:"
	 - Star temperatures
	 - Star Radii
	 - Star bolometric luminosities
	 - Star masses (*big* maybe on this one)
	 - Stellar variability periods (for those stars which have variable light curves)
	    - Period-Luminosity function for variable stars
	 - Stellar populations on a HR diagram
??? note "Galaxies:"
	 - Galaxy classification
		- Do different classes have different colour/luminosity?
		- Are there different populations of stars in different areas of a galaxy?
	 - Galaxy rotation curves
		- Do galaxies have black holes?
			- Do black holes have radio emission? Does radio emission depend on galaxy type?
			- How massive are the black holes?
		- Do galaxies have dark matter?
??? note "Galaxy clusters:"
	 - How many galaxies are in clusters?
	 - Galaxy cluster rotation curves
		- Do galaxy clusters have dark matter?
	 - Galaxy type vs position in the cluster?
??? note "Universe overall:"
	 - What is the hubble constant? (**_this is the main goal of analysis!_**)
	 - Where are supernovae/flashes? How often do they occur? What is their intrinsic brightness?
	 - Is the universe homogeneous and/or isotropic? 
	 - Are galaxies the same colour at any distance?
