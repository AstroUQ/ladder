# Welcome to a new Universe!

This website serves as an introduction to, a tutorial of how to analyse, and some documentation for a simulated universe in the context of an astronomical distance ladder. 

What is an astronomical distance ladder? Using several techniques and physical properties of stars, galaxies, etc, a distance scale of the universe can be formulated.

Formulating a distance scale is really important if you want to know anything about everything! So much so that it has formed the basis of much of modern astronomy and cosmology. What better way to learn about it than to try it out yourself?

On the [About page](About.md) you'll find all of the physics that is actually emulated in this simulation, as well as some important information about the simulation. There are a few datasets on the [datasets page](Datasets.md). Head there if you want to download some data or generate your own! 

All of the information you could need about the datasets is available in the [Analysing Data section](Analysing Data/introduction.md). In there, I've also included a [tutorial/walkthrough](Analysing Data/Walkthrough/introduction.md) as to one way to analyse the data and infer properties about a particular universe.
