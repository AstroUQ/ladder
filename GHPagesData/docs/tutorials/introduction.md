## To start off...
This simulation was programmed in Python and it was designed with analysis in Python in mind. Of course, you can use any language you'd like to look at and analyse the data but we **strongly** recommend Python due to its versatility and use in astronomy. 

We have included example Python notebooks in a series of [tutorials](tutorials/introduction.md) in how to analyse the data. As you are encouraged to learn in each lesson, more tutorial pages will progressively become available over the semester covering each new topic. A week after each lesson, we will update tutorials for the previous week to reflect any issues that have arisen and give fuller answers to problems you are solving, so that nobody is left behind by the end of semester. 

## What you can find
In principle, and with enough effort, you could find most of if not all of the physics that is simulated in this program. A full grade can be obtained without finding _everything_ though! Below is a non-exhaustive list of what you could determine:

??? note "Stars:"
	 - Star temperatures
	 - Star Radii
	 - Star bolometric luminosities
	 - Star masses (*big* maybe on this one)
	 - Stellar variability periods (for those stars which have variable light curves)
	    - Period-Luminosity function for variable stars
	 - Stellar populations on a HR diagram
??? note "Galaxies:"
	 - Galaxy classification
		- Do different classes have different colour/luminosity?
		- Are there different populations of stars in different areas of a galaxy?
	 - Galaxy rotation curves
		- Do galaxies have black holes?
			- Do black holes have radio emission? Does radio emission depend on galaxy type?
			- How massive are the black holes?
		- Do galaxies have dark matter?
??? note "Galaxy clusters:"
	 - How many galaxies are in clusters?
	 - Galaxy cluster rotation curves
		- Do galaxy clusters have dark matter?
	 - Galaxy type vs position in the cluster?
??? note "Universe overall:"
	 - What is the hubble constant? (**_this is the main goal of analysis!_**)
	 - Where are flashes? How often do they occur? What is their intrinsic brightness? Where do they come from?
	 - Is the universe homogeneous and/or isotropic? 
	 - Are galaxies the same colour at any distance?
