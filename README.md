## About
As part of the University of Queensland course *PHYS3080 - Extragalactic Astrophysics and Cosmology*, we students were given data from a simulated universe (programmed by the course staff) to create an astronomical distance ladder. Both the data analysis and the simulation itself fascinated me, so I'd decided to try my hand at emulating the simulation myself. While some aspects in this simulation aren't as polished as the data we were given as students, some new features have been added, and others extended. I'm really happy with the results so far, and I aim to work on it and tweak the code for a while to come. 

As python is the language I'm most capable in, this project is written entirely in python. Several packages were used extensively, including but not limited to: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`, `multiprocessing`, and `scipy`.

## Extent of Simulation
Several real aspects of astronomy are modelled (to varying degrees of accuracy) in this simulation. Below is a non-exhaustive list of the physical properties that could, in theory, be derived via quantitative and qualitative means from the output data `.txt` files.
### Stars

 - Four distinct classes of stars are generated: Main Sequence, Giants, Supergiants, and White Dwarfs. They can be see on the HR diagram on the right in their usual positions.
   - Main sequence stars are generated realistically according to luminosity-mass functions (with the mass first randomly generated via a gamma distribution), and then the radius generated according to mass-radius relations. The temperature is then solved via the Stefan-Boltzmann equation. I am quite happy with the behaviour of the MS stars!
   - White dwarf mass distributions were generated according to a published paper on the topic. Radius was then generated by the R~M^(1/3) relation and temperature derived from wikipedia data. The luminosity then was taken via the Stefan-Boltzmann law. 
   - The giant and supergiant parameter generation was far less realistic and was artificially chosen to give nice looking data on a HR diagram.

- Some populations of stars, depending on their position on the HR diagram, will have variable light curves. The simulation will determine whether to have two or three distinct variable populations, with a "short" (18-30 hour) period and a "long" (45-60 hour period) being certain. A "longest" (75-100 hour) period class of variable has a 1/3 chance of being generated too. Each of these classes of variables are shown as triangles in the HR diagram above, with the top population being the short period, the rightmost population being the longest period, and the bottom left being the long period. 
  - The lightcurve of variable stars is randomly chosen out of a Sine, Triangle, or Sawtooth wave, with some random scatter added onto 'normalised flux'.
  - The period-luminosity relation (linear trend on a logY-x scale) has a randomly assigned sign with a random gradient within some small range of the desired parameters. This is generated at the universe level in `Universe.py`.

### Galaxies

   - Classification of galaxy types. cD, E0-7, S0 and Sa-c, SBa-c galaxy types are simulated to a reasonable degree of accuracy. 
   - Different star populations are found throughout galaxies. In spirals, the bulge/bar has lower mass, redder stars. The leading edges of spirals have high mass blue stars, with lower mass redder stars trailing the leading edges. Elliptical galaxies are characterised by many more, lower mass red stars.
   - Rotation curves are simulated accurately according to newtonian physics, with black holes and dark matter (via the Navarro-Frenk-White profile) influencing rotation velocities.

## To-Do:
- [ ] Make this damn README.md prettier!!
- [ ] Fill out many docstrings and comment all code to a degree readable by other users.
- [ ] Set it so that some galaxies don't have a black hole and/or dark matter, with probability depending on galaxy type. 
- [ ] Output some luminosity data about black holes. Maybe under x-ray data?
- [ ] Make brightness of black holes depend on angle of the galaxy to the viewer? As well as mass and random activity (possibly depending on galaxy type)
