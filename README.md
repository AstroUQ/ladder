# Simulated-Universe
## About
I am intending to emulate the "Distance Ladder" universe simulation that was a part of the UQ course PHYS3080, potentially adding a few bells and whistles along the way. 

## To-Do:
 - Stars:
    - Simulate variability in some regions on the HR diagram. 
 - Black Holes:
    - Make brightness depend on angle of the galaxy to the viewer? As well as mass and random activity (possibly depending on galaxy type)
 - Generate a new type of galaxy (very distant) that is not comprised of stars
    - Needs size (arcseconds), luminosity data, radial velocity and position.
