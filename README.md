# Simulated-Universe
## About
I am intending to emulate the "Distance Ladder" universe simulation that was a part of the UQ course PHYS3080, potentially adding a few bells and whistles along the way. 

## To-Do:
 - Black Holes:
    - Make brightness depend on angle of the galaxy to the viewer? As well as mass and random activity (possibly depending on galaxy type)
 - Universe:
	- Tweak the galaxy cluster distribution to give less close galaxies, and truncate the distribution at the universe radius.
