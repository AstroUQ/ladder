## About
As part of the University of Queensland course *PHYS3080 - Extragalactic Astrophysics and Cosmology*, students are given data from a simulated universe (programmed by the course staff) to create an astronomical distance ladder.

This project is written in python with python analysis in mind.


## Extent of Simulation
Several real aspects of astronomy are modelled (to varying degrees of accuracy) in this simulation. This includes (but is not limited to) the cosmological principle, galaxy and cluster distributions, stellar distributions within galaxies, basic stellar physics (Stefan Boltzmann law, etc), dark matter, and black holes. Most of these features are optional, and some generated universes may have these physical properties and some may not.
