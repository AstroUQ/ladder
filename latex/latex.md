# Preparing a Report

You can use whichever software you like to write your report, so long as it follows the [structure outlined above](report.md). But most scientists use the software LaTeX and we encourage you to as well; this is great practice for Honours, where your writing will all be required to be in LaTeX.

In writing your report, please **put your group number at the top**, with your own name as first author and your colleagues as co-authors.

## Using LaTeX

Almost all scientific papers in astronomy are published using the typesetting software LaTeX, which not everyone may have used before. Here is a good [guide to using LaTeX](https://astrobites.org/2018/01/20/getting-started-with-latex/) by the astronomy student collective *astrobites*. It is a *markup language* that allows you to include attractive figures and tables, mathematical notation, and easily keep track of citations with [BibTeX](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Bibliography_management_with_bibtex). 

The easiest way to use LaTeX is via [Overleaf](overleaf.com), which is sort of like Google Docs for LaTeX, and allows you to share a document with your team and work collaboratively.

Most of these papers are published in one of the major national journals, and there are Overleaf templates for each. In this report, **you are required to use the template for the Australian national journal**,  the [*Proceedings of the Astronomical Society of Australia* (PASA)](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/cup-large2-template/sbvfyncxcbcm).

## Using Word

If you absolutely cannot use LaTeX, please ask. If necessary are allowed to use Microsoft Word, or another commercial word processor, but you should adhere to the same structure for a journal article as outlined above.

## Example Reports

Here are a few good example reports from previous years. Keep in mind that these reports may have been for a different type of universe and different version of code!
