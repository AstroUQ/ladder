# Preparing a Report

You can use whichever software you like to write your report, so long as it follows the [structure outlined above](report.md). But most scientists use the software LaTeX and we encourage you to as well; this is great practice for Honours, where your writing will all be required to be in LaTeX.

## Using LaTeX

Almost all scientific papers in astronomy are published using the typesetting software LaTeX, which not everyone may have used before. Here is a good [guide to using LaTeX](https://astrobites.org/2018/01/20/getting-started-with-latex/) by the astronomy student collective *astrobites*. It is a *markup language* that allows you to include attractive figures and tables, mathematical notation, and easily keep track of citations with [BibTeX])(https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Bibliography_management_with_bibtex). 

The easiest way to use LaTeX is via [Overleaf](overleaf.com), which is sort of like Google Docs for LaTeX, and allows you to share a document with your team and work collaboratively.

Most of these papers are published in one of the major national journals, and there are Overleaf templates for each: 

- the American [*Astrophysical Journal* (ApJ)](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/aastex-template-for-submissions-to-aas-journals-apj-aj-apjs-apjl-psj-rnaas/vwyggrqvhcgz),
- the British [*Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society* (MNRAS)](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/monthly-notices-of-the-royal-astronomical-society-mnras-latex-template-and-guide-for-authors/kqnjzrwjwjth),
- the European [*Astronomy & Astrophysics* (A&A)](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/astronomy-and-astrophysics-template/ngdddtchkbcg), 
- or the [*Proceedings of the Astronomical Society of Australia* (PASA)](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/cup-large2-template/sbvfyncxcbcm).

You are allowed to use any template in LaTex or otherwise, but I recommend ApJ is the nicest.

## Using Word

You may nevertheless prefer to use Microsoft Word, or another commercial word processor. This is fine, but you should adhere to the same structure for a journal article as outlined above.

## Example Reports

Here are several good example reports from previous years:
