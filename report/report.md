# Writing a Report

The assessment for the Distance Ladder project, and the follow-up Cosmology project, is based on writing a long-form report. For many of you this may be the longest you have done in a Physics major, but this is a very important skill - a practising scientist, in academia, government, or industry, spends typically more of their time reading and writing papers and proposals than doing calculations or working in the lab. 

Reports should follow the PASA journal format if at all possible. They should contain a title (including your group number), with first-author being your name and coauthors your group colleagues, a clearly structured main body and either an abstract or a summary. Aim at writing 10 to 15 pages. Make sure figures are properly labeled, including legible and informative axis labels and units. **Do not** include lengthy data tables or source code in your report. There is a light science-fiction setting in the course materials; you are allowed (and encouraged) to name things as you like, with as much whimsy or humour as you please, so long as the content is clear and understandable and the report is otherwise written like a scientific paper.

In brief - you will get a 5 if you have a reasonably well written report across all marking criteria, with the only *essential* science content being a determination of the Hubble constant. Higher marks will be awarded for better-written reports that determine more physics about the universe.

You will be guaranteed to get feedback on a draft report if you [send it to Ben](mailto:b.pope@uq.edu.au) by **7 days before the deadline**. If you send a draft later than that, he will do his best to get to you but may not have the opportunity.

## Structure of a Scientific Report

You are required to follow the standard structure for scientific writing in your report, just as if you were writing a real paper. Writing papers like this is one of the main things you are expected to do in real-world science, and a good practice for your Honours thesis.

**Structure**:

- **Title**: pick a punchy title that accurately encapsulates what you did. You can include your group number here, or under Affiliations.
- **Authors and Affiliations**: here you list authors and affiliations (ie which university or institute each person is from; for you this will all be UQ, but most science is done by teams spread across many institutes). In astronomy the first author is the main person responsible, but in some fields of science this is the *last* author for historical reasons. In your report you should put your own name first, and then list all your team members.
- **Abstract**: 200 words summarizing what you did. Every day hundreds of papers are published, and scientists mainly skim the title and abstract before deciding whether to read a paper. I like to follow a condensed form of the paper itself: start with
    - state the overall topic 
    - what is a problem with our current understanding
    - state your new idea, data, or technique that you can use to solve this problem
    - state your results
    - briefly summarize the results' relevance to the overall topic
- **Introduction**: Give the reader the context they need to understand your paper. Not just a brain dump, but state how it fits into their knowledge: in order, say what is the topic, what do we not understand, and why write this paper now. Science is an ongoing international conversation about the natural world, and people want to know where in this conversation your work fits. There is typically a new idea, dataset, technique, invention, or something else that has motivated a new contribution to the literature. 
- **Methods**: You can break this up into subsections if you like. This is where you summarize what is in the data, and how you analysed it (eg with what software). Do not include raw code; if you want to link to your software, you can include a link to a GitHub repository. 
- **Results**: What did you find? You should include subsections for the Hubble constant, and anything you did about period-luminosity relations, stellar populations, galaxies, the structure of the universe, et cetera. 
- **Discussion**: How do you *interpret* your results? This can be long or brief as you please.
- **Conclusions**: It can be hard to get the hang of writing a conclusions section - how does it differ from *Discussion*? The difference is that in *Conclusions* you talk more about the relevance of your paper to the broad questions addressed in the abstract and introduction, and to the 
- **Appendices**: You don't need appendices, and you probably shouldn't have any. Your report definitely shouldn't include any large tables of raw data or code, and marks will be deducted if you include any. But if you have tables of *reduced* data like stellar temperatures or galaxy masses, or long calculations, this is where this would go.

Here are some examples of papers by my team and colleagues that you might like to follow for structure:

- ["Modelling Cosmic Radiation Events in the Tree-ring Radiocarbon Record", Zhang et al, *RSPA*, 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13775)
- ["The TESS View of LOFAR Radio-Emitting Stars", Pope et al, *ApJL*, 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04759)
- ["Aldebaran b's temperate past uncovered in planet search data", Farr et al, ApJL, 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.09812)
