# Uncertainties in Data
Due to the nature of taking measurements, all measurements have an inherent uncertainty in their true values. 

### Variable Star Data
Each `.txt` file within this directory has measurement uncertainty corresponding to

 Measurement | Uncertainty | Unit 
 --- | --- | --- 
 Time | +/- 0.3 | hours
 NormalisedFlux | +/- 1.5 | % 

### `Distant Galaxy Data.txt`

 Measurement | Uncertainty | Unit 
 --- | --- | --- 
 Equatorial | +/- 0.0001 | degrees
 Polar | +/- 0.0001 | degrees
 BlueF | +/- 1 | %
 GreenF | +/- 1 | %
 RedF | +/- 1 | %
 Size | +/- 10 | %
 RadialVelocity | +/- 0.1 | km/s

### `Radio Source Data.txt`
